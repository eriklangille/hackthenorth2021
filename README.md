# Bloom

Bloom enhances an elderly person's connections to their family by providing them a portal to  events into their relative's lives. They can integrate the app on a tablet into their home to remind them what is important in their life.

We accomplish this by providing the user a list of tasks managed by their family, a visual family tree, and a photo gallery with messages that family members have sent.

The app has two different interfaces â€” one for family members more familiar with apps, and one for their elderly family member.
