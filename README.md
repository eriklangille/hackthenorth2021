# Bloom

Bloom enhances an elderly person's connection to their family by providing a portal to their relative's lives. The app is located on a tablet within their home. This way, the family and their memories become an integral part of this persons everyday life.

We accomplish this by providing the user a list of tasks managed by their family, a visual family tree, and a photo gallery with messages that family members have sent.

The app has two different interfaces â€” a mobile app for family members to send memories, and the aforementioned tablet app for their elderly family member.
